## Quotes

> But the cybernetic organism, so far, is more like a cybernetic mob than new collective human brain. People are being reduced to externally configurable nervous systems, while computers are free to network and think in more advanced ways than we ever will. _(Rushkoff, p. 11)_

This quote stood out to me because it highlights the very chaotic current situation of the internet. Many people now online are trapped inside filter bubbles and behind algorithms. They often end up lost or swept along the current. We need to better understand the system to remind, question and redirect people.

> They not only copy our intellectual processes—our repeatable programs—but they also discourage our more complex processes—our higher order cognition, contemplation, innovation, and meaning making that should be the reward of “outsourcing” our arithmetic to silicon chips in the fi rst place. _(Rushkoff, p. 17)_

I think this quote really anticipates the relationship between people and AI now. We often treat AI as a “black box technology”, where we put most effort into prompt engineering and then hope for the best. The key may be to find the balance between automation and human creativity, between individual and collective thinking among “cybernetic organisms”.

> Freedom—even in a digital age—means freedom to choose how and with whom you do your reflection, and not everything needs to be posted for the entire world with “comments on” and “copyright off.” In fact, it’s the inability to draw these boundaries and distinctions—or the political incorrectness of suggesting the possibility—that paints us into corners, and prevents meaningful, ongoing, open-ended discussion. _(Rushkoff, p. 18–19)_

I also resonate with this comment because there are already ongoing arguments about freedom of speech and how freedom and responsibility actually go hand-in-hand. I strongly agree with Rushkoff here on the importance of the ability to set boundaries, which provide safer spaces for making meaningful reflections and discussions.
