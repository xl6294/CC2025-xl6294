# Assignment 5: Projection Mapping Workshop

## Overview

For this assignment, I plan to bring back the robot graphics (from assignment 4) as they are mainly composed of simple shapes like circles,arcs, strokes, and points. I also want to reuse my approach with the time functions (from assignment 3) to synchronize three sketches that will share a same base code, with only minimal variations.

## Process + Links to Drafts on p5.js Web Editor

1. In this draft, I figured out most of the functionality, except that the timing of animation. Right now, the pause of the robots after bloomed into full forms is too short, and there is a long gap after the exit of the first robot and before the entering of the next one.

2. Here I figured out the correct timing, and I added in the expressions/faces of the robots.
