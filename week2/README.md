# Week 2

For this assignment, I worked on recreating the form of a geometric crow based on a reference image. I used GeoGebra to plan the composition and identify the key coordinates, which helped me avoid intensive manual calculations.

I also experimented with using expressions and variables from fractions of the 'windowWidth' to make the shapes scalable and movable. However, the results were often too large for a landscape canvas, so I switched to using 'windowHeight' as the reference instead, which made the scaling more manageable.

## Shape-drawing functions I used:
- triangle()
- beginShape() / endShape()
- circle()
- arc()
- rect()
