# Assignment 2 ‚Äî Generative Pattern

## Overview

- üå∏ I created a flower-like pattern. Each grid cell contains a flower drawn with pie arcs, and the number of petals increases per row.
- üëÜ The distance between the cursor and the center of each cell determines the length of the petals. Farther away leads to smaller petals and larger central hole. A yellor circle fills the hole as the pistil.
- üñ±Ô∏è When the mouse is pressed, the flowers begin spinning (rotation animation using [`framCount`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/frameCount/)). The shape and appearance of flowers are also altered. Nearby flowers expand, and distant ones shrink and are replaced by faint placeholder flowers.
- üé® I used [HSB](https://www.learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html) color mode where Hue changes diagonally across the canvas and Opacity fades from top-left (solid) to bottom-right (transparent).
