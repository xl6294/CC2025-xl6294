# Assignment 2 ‚Äî Generative Pattern

## Overview

- üå∏ I created a flower-like pattern. Each grid cell contains a flower drawn with pie arcs, and the number of petals increases per row.
- üëÜ The distance between the cursor and the center of each cell determines the length of the petals. Farther away leads to smaller petals and larger central hole. A yellor circle fills the hole as the pistil.
- üñ±Ô∏è When the mouse is pressed, the flowers begin spinning (rotation animation using [`framCount`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/frameCount/)). The shape and appearance of flowers are also altered. Nearby flowers expand, and distant ones shrink and are replaced by faint placeholder flowers.
- üé® I used [HSB](https://www.learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html) color mode where Hue changes diagonally across the canvas and Opacity fades from top-left (solid) to bottom-right (transparent).

1. [Drafting a single cell](https://editor.p5js.org/xl6294/sketches/cOgVBtshJ)
   - In this first sketch, I‚Äôm drafting the single motif element that will later appear in each grid cell with a `for loop`. I created a full-window canvas with a scale factor based on the smaller window dimension (width or height) using math object `min()` to simulate a 100√ó100 canvas by scale. The component variations ‚Äî like the number of petals (which will later correspond to the number of rows) and the petal thickness (which will link to the number of columns) ‚Äî are currently mapped to the mouse‚Äôs X and Y positions for experimentation.
2. [Drafting control by mouse position](https://editor.p5js.org/xl6294/sketches/2wfSsoC7u)
   - In this sketch, I introduce another variation controlled by the mouse position, utilizing the `dist()` function to create a distance-based effect. The length of the petals, `eH`, now depends on the distance between the mouse and the center of each flower. Within a specific range (calculation using `sqrt()` from the [JavaScript Math object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)), the closer the mouse is to the center, the shorter the petals become, eventually creating a larger central hole in the flower.
3. [Drafting two-dimensional `for loops` (X, Y)](https://editor.p5js.org/xl6294/sketches/xV0v9_GYF)
   - In this sketch, I‚Äôm drafting the 2D `for loops` to lay out the grid of flower motifs. I‚Äôve backed out the scaling and returned each single-element motif to its original 100√ó100 size. I also relinked petal count and petal width from mouse position to their row/column positions. I used both calculation and guesswork when deciding what should stay linked vs. unlinked, and which values should remain fixed versus scaled.
4. [Drafting rendering and animation when mouse is pressed](https://editor.p5js.org/xl6294/sketches/aevphcJ8f)
   - In this iteration, I‚Äôm adding animation so that the flower motifs rotate using a `windSpeed` variable based on `frameCount`, which kicks in whenever the mouse is pressed. I‚Äôm also introducing color with HSB, allowing me to create a gradient by using a variable for the hue value. Hue shifts across the grid from bottom left to top right, while opacity fades toward the bottom right. I used `map()` and [JavaScript Math objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) like `max()`, `min()`, and `abs()`.
5. [Interesting error which leads to final result](https://editor.p5js.org/xl6294/sketches/biFKRkiWc)
   - While tweaking the hue parameter, I accidentally changed the mapping for `eH` (the petal length) to be negative, which flips the arc outside its cell and creates an inside-out popping effect. It was an unexpected but interesting mistake, so I later integrated it into the final result.
6. [Last draft (without pistil and placeholder grey flowers)](https://editor.p5js.org/xl6294/sketches/n2t3OMrHS)
   - This is the last draft where everything came together, including the popping animation effect that appears when the mouse is pressed. At this moment, I‚Äôve only used one `arc()` draw function for the entire composition, embedded within three `for loops`. I later added the yellow pistil and the placeholder grey flower to the final product, utilizing multiple draw functions as required.
